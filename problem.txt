Stable marriage problem

Problem description
Given an equal number of men and women to be paired for marriage, each man ranks all the women in order of his preference and each women ranks all the men in order of her preference. 
A stable set of engagements for marriage is one where no man prefers a women over the one he is engaged to, where that other woman also prefers that man over the one she is engaged to. I.e. with consulting marriages, there would be no reason for the engagements between the people to change. 
Output should be a stable set of engagements for any set of preferences.

function stableMatching {
    Initialize all m ∈ M and w ∈ W to free
    while ∃ free man m who still has a woman w to propose to {
       w = m's highest ranked woman to whom he has not yet proposed
       if w is free
         (m, w) become engaged
       else some pair (m', w) already exists
         if w prefers m to m'
           (m, w) become engaged
           m' becomes free
         else
